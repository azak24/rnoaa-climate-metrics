# rnoaa-climate-metrics
Pulling weather station data from rnoaa to calculate metrics of winter climate in Pennsylvania for 1994-2004 and 2013-2023.

Stations with relevant climate data from 1994-2004 and 2013-2023 were identified, then climate data for these years and stations were pulled. Weather station data were used to calculate four climate metrics: Average annual snowfall, degree days below freezing, number of days with snow cover, and number of days with maximum temperature below freezing. Point data are exported for later interpolation in ESRI ArcGIS Pro. Final climate surfaces were used as covariates in snowshoe hare occupancy model.
